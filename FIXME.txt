to be fixed for next iteration of SFs:
   
   - PU distributions for 2017: some of the samples, already have the correct PU distribution (see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RTFfWOmyYE9Rkio-LX3XC4EKWINDtQAR4xfkav4xWRQ/edit#gid=0, but note that not all samples in the google doc have been checked), therefore some histograms used for PU reweighting have to be updated

   - datacards: lumi uncertainty should not be applied to fake background and to W*->munu/W*->taunu samples
   
   - real tau background should also be treated as signal (in tauId, tau ES and trigger measurement)
   
   - Danny suggested to include a new control region to be able to constrain the fake factors better (for tauId and trigger):
    W*->enu + jets , Can this solve the problem of low tau Id SF in 2017?
   - what has to be changed if both passing and failing probes need a non-closure correction?
   
further ideas:

   - having GoFs tests for closure and pre-fit plots would be nice and helpful
   
   - Riccardo suggested to use a Neural Network for the determination of the fake rate
